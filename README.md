Hello reviewer

Thanks for reading our paper and code.

Here, we introduce the implementation of the proposed model and the score fusion methods. The first stage consisting of preprocessing 
and building the input data will be added later since it requires the full access to private database which reveals the authors’ identities. 
Yet, sample result is included in a Jupyter Notebook (Code_Simulation.ipynb) where you can observe the outputs of this stage.

To investigate the result of different true user ID, search the 'Set Target Subject' and change the variable ‘ID’ to a different 
value ranging from 1 to 42. 

The data (Example_database.mat) and the code (Code_Simulation.ipynb or Code_Simulation.py) should be placed in the same directory.

@ We recommend using the Jupyter Notebook for running the code for more clarity.

@@ In case of using .py file, please enter the following command while locating .py and .mat files in same location. You should also change the location of the environment to that directory.
   - !python Code_Simulation.py
   - You should change the true user ID inside the .py file.
   - You need to change the command, depending on the environment. For example, in Git bash, you should use $ python ./Code_Simulation.py


We really appreciate all of your hard work and effort. Thank you so much.


Sincerely,
